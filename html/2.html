                 <h1>Variables</h1>
                 <p>
                 How does a program keep an internal state? How does it remember things?
                 We have seen how to produce new values from old values, but this does not
                 change the old values, and the new value has to be immediately used or it
                 will dissipate again. To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing
                 called a variable.
                 <br>
                 var caught = 5 * 5;
                 <br>
                 And that gives us our second kind of statement. The special word (key-
                 word) var indicates that this sentence is going to define a variable. It is fol-
                 lowed by the name of the variable and, if we want to immediately give it a
                 value, by an = operator and an expression.
                 The previous statement creates a variable called caught and uses it to
                 grab hold of the number that is produced by multiplying 5 by 5.
                 <br>
                 After a variable has been defined, its name can be used as an expression.
                 The value of such an expression is the value the variable currently holds.
                 Here’s an example:
                 <br>
                 var ten = 10;
                 <br>
                 console.log(ten * ten);
                 <br>
                 // . 100
                 <br>
                 Variable names can be any word that isn’t reserved as a keyword such
                 as var )(. They may not include spaces. Digits can also be part of variable
                 names— catch22 is a valid name, for example—but the name must not start
                 with a digit. A variable name cannot include punctuation, except for the
                 characters $ and _ .
                 When a variable points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that
                 value forever. The = operator can be used at any time on existing variables
                 to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a
                 new one.)
